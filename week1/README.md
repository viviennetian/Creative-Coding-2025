# Week 1 Reading Reflections

## Selected Quotes

### 1. Douglas Rushkoff, _Program or Be Programmed_

> “Retailers migrate online only to find their prices undercut by automatic shopping aggregators. (p. 9)”

> “As a result, most of society remains one full dimensional leap of awareness and capability behind the few who manage to monopolize access to the real power of any media age. (p. 14)”

> “Instead of optimizing our machines for humanity—or even the benefit of some particular group—we are optimizing humans for machinery. (p. 15)”

I really like the retailer example, because I’ve talked with my parents about their business and the shift from offline to online retail, so I can understand that feeling of being controlled. Promotion prices change arbitrarily depending on the platform, and you can only accept it passively. You never really know what return you’ll get on the money you put in, since the algorithm is a black box.
In the same way, peers’ tastes and aesthetics (sometimes even pushed by algorithms, to the point of getting too much plastic surgery because that kind of look is favored by the algorithm and more likely to be recommended), and daily habits (like the widespread reversal of day and night schedules), are all examples of people adapting to technology rather than technology adapting to people.
Always one step behind, being led by technology instead of being the creator toward which technology should lean.

### 2. Jathan Sadowski, _The Mechanic and The Luddite_ (Chapter 2)

> “The mechanic knows how a machine operates, how it is put together, and how it can be repaired or reengineered. The Luddite knows why the machine was built, whose purposes it serves, and when it should be disassembled or destroyed. (p. 46)”

> “Technology is far too important to be thought of as just a grab bag of neat gadgets. And it’s far too powerful to be left in the hands of billionaire executives and venture capitalists. We deserve a say in who creates it and how it’s controlled. (p. 46)”

When I read these quotes, I feel the real issue is control. Whoever controls new technology often becomes the next billionaire. So even if we say technology should be for everyone, in reality the power and profit usually stay in the hands of a few people. That’s the main problem we need to face.

### 3. Patrick Lin, _Why We’re Not Using AI in This Course, Despite Its Obvious Benefits_

> “I hope you choose to exercise your privilege of being human with a direct connection to reality, not through an AI filter or middleman by letting it do your thinking.”

> “What is the point of a 4-year **university** or a general education?”
> “What is the point of **work?**”
> “What is the value of **creativity?**”
> “What is the value of **free time?**”
> “Why is **cheating** even bad in the first place?””

I think we can give a simple answer to the essay’s final question. Whether in work or in study, people are always searching for meaning. Most often, that sense of meaning comes from creating something—whether it’s producing work, learning, or even just cooking a beautiful meal for your family. We are always trying to balance work and free time: when there is too much work, people long for freedom, but when there is too much freedom, it often becomes hard to find joy in life. Then people go back to work, finding recognition of their own existence through what they do.

The issue of using AI is similar. In the process of creating—whether writing a short essay or making a artistic project—if the central content is generated by AI, you lose your personality. You can’t show your uniqueness, so others won’t see your ideas or recognize you. And in the end, you may not even feel that deeper recognition of yourself, the sense that your life and work really have meaning.

That said, I do think AI can still be very practical when it’s used as a tool for learning about tools or technologies that already exist in the world. For example, using AI to help organize resources or summarize information can make the learning process easier without replacing your own voice.
