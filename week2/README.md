# Week 2: Intro to P5.js

---

## Hello Kitty with P5.js!

- Using `rect()`, `ellipse()`,`beginShape()`,`endShape()`, `bezierVertex()`, and `circle()`.

- Using variables and iterating them to draw background pink circles.

- I drew the outline of Kitty's face and bowknot in Illustrator, and let GPT handle the boring part: converting the SVG paths into the parameters for `bezierVertex()`.

- Using `push()` and `pop()` functions for grouping positioning and controlling `strokeWeight()` and `fills()` separately.
